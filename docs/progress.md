### What I Worked On Today:
- Watched the **Asyncio in Python - Full Tutorial** to get more comfortable with asynchronous programming using `asyncio`.
- Revised key concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** from the book *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* (covered approx. 30 pages).

### Key Takeaways:
- Gained a better understanding of how to use `asyncio` for managing concurrent tasks in Python, which will be crucial for real-time data ingestion in the project.
- Revisited fundamental OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, which will help structure the trading system effectively.
