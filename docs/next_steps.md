# Next Steps

## MVP Definition

Our **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** will be a simplified version of the high-frequency trading (HFT) system that includes the core components necessary to demonstrate its functionality. The MVP will focus on real-time market data processing, a basic trading strategy, trade execution, and performance monitoring.

### Key Components of the MVP:

1. **Real-Time Market Data Ingestion**:
   - Connect to a live market data API (e.g., Binance WebSocket API or similar).
   - Use asynchronous programming (`asyncio`) to process real-time data streams.
   - Parse and validate incoming market data.

2. **Basic Trading Algorithm**:
   - Implement a simple algorithmic trading strategy (e.g., moving average crossover).
   - The strategy will generate buy/sell signals based on real-time data.

3. **Simulated Trade Execution**:
   - Create a module to simulate trade executions (or use paper trading).
   - Log executed trades for analysis and performance review.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Use a database (PostgreSQL or SQLite) to store market data and trade logs.
   - Ensure that the database can handle frequent read/write operations for high-frequency data.

5. **Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - Build a web-based dashboard using Django or Flask.
   - Display real-time market data, trading signals, and executed trades.
   - Show basic performance metrics (profit/loss, trade history).

6. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Use `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent tasks such as data ingestion, signal generation, and trade execution.

## Project Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**:
   - **API Integration**: Connect to a reliable market data API (e.g., Binance) for live data streams.
   - **Data Parsing**: Parse and validate incoming price, volume, and order book data.

2. **Trading Strategy Implementation**:
   - **Basic Strategy**: Implement a simple moving average crossover strategy.
   - **Signal Generation**: Generate buy/sell signals based on configurable parameters.

3. **Simulated Trade Execution**:
   - **Execution Logic**: Simulate trades and log trade actions (buy, sell, hold).
   - **Logging**: Record trades in the database for further analysis.

4. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - **Database Setup**: Use PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing market data, trading signals, and trade logs.
   - **Efficient Queries**: Ensure that the database is optimized for high-frequency data operations.

5. **Monitoring and Dashboard**:
   - **Web Interface**: Build a dashboard to display live data, trading activity, and performance metrics.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Ensure the dashboard refreshes with real-time data updates.

6. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - **Concurrency**: Utilize `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent processes (e.g., data ingestion, signal generation).
   - **Non-blocking Operations**: Ensure that data streaming and trade execution do not block each other.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**:
   - The system should be designed to handle increased data loads and allow for easy addition of new trading strategies.

2. **Reliability**:
   - Implement robust error handling for API connections and data parsing.
   - Ensure the system can recover gracefully from failures.

3. **Security**:
   - Secure sensitive information (API keys, etc.) using environment variables or configuration files excluded from version control.

4. **Performance**:
   - Optimize the system for low-latency trade execution and data ingestion.
   - Use `asyncio` to ensure non-blocking concurrent tasks.

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Follow best practices for clean, modular, and well-documented code to make future enhancements easier.

6. **User Experience**:
   - The dashboard should be intuitive and responsive, allowing users to easily view trade data and performance metrics.
