## Introduction

Welcome to the start of a new journey! This repository will serve as the foundation for a project I've long been planning to embark on, but never quite felt ready forâ€”until now. The goal is to develop a project in the domain of **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** using **Big Data** technologies, primarily in Python, alongside a variety of other frameworks and languages that I havenâ€™t yet explored in depth.

This will be an open repository where you can follow along with my progress, see my decisions (both the good and the not-so-good), and hopefully, gain insights into how Iâ€™m tackling the challenges of this ambitious project.

## Motivation

For a long time, Iâ€™ve wanted to create something meaningful on my ownâ€”something big and complex, but I often found myself hesitating. I always thought, *"Now is not the right time"* or *"I donâ€™t know enough yet."* But Iâ€™ve realized that waiting for the perfect moment or the perfect knowledge will only delay progress indefinitely. The most important thing is to **start**â€”and to start **today**.

## Acknowledge the Learning Curve

As I move forward, Iâ€™m fully aware that Iâ€™ll make mistakes. Some of the solutions I come up with may not be the most optimal, but Iâ€™m embracing the learning process. One quote that has stuck with me over the years is from **Steve Jobs**:

> *"Some mistakes will be made along the way. That's good. Because some decisions are being made along the way. We'll find the mistakes. We'll fix them."*

This quote will guide me throughout this project. The focus here is on making progress, learning from mistakes, and improving as I go. My goal is to document every step, even if it includes missteps or suboptimal decisions, because that's how real learning happens.

This repository will remain open, and anyone interested is welcome to follow along, contribute, or offer feedback. I will aim to provide detailed commit messages and explanations so that you can understand my thought process and the specific challenges Iâ€™m tackling at each stage of development.

## Project Outline

- **Technologies**: While the majority of this project will be developed in Python, Iâ€™m planning to explore and learn new tools and frameworks that I havenâ€™t had much experience with, such as:
  - Web frameworks like **Django** or **Flask**
  - Database systems like **PostgreSQL** or **ElasticSearch**
  - Concurrency and async programming using **asyncio**
  - Real-time data streaming with **WebSockets** or **Kafka**
  - Containerization and deployment with **Docker**
  - Big Data technologies like **Cassandra**, **Spark**, etc.
  - APIs: **REST**, **WebSockets**, **gRPC**

- **Commitment**: I will try to commit code as frequently as possibleâ€”hopefully every day. That said, I understand and accept that this may not always be feasible. The key is **consistency** over time, even if itâ€™s not every single day.

## Goals of the Project

- **Learning**: To push myself out of my comfort zone by working with technologies I havenâ€™t yet mastered.
- **Experimentation**: To try new approaches and frameworks, understanding that not every solution will be perfect.
- **Transparency**: To document each stage of the project openly so that others can follow my thought process, even when I make mistakes.
- **Completion**: To develop a working system by the end of the year, building a solid foundation for further exploration into High-Frequency Trading.

## What to Expect

- **Frequent Updates**: I will document the development process here. I plan to commit code often and provide explanations about why certain decisions were made.
- **Challenges and Mistakes**: Expect to see the ups and downs of building something from scratch. I wonâ€™t shy away from showing where I struggled or made mistakesâ€”those are part of the learning journey.
- **Growth**: I believe this will be a great learning path for me, and I hope it will offer valuable insights to anyone following along.

## Looking Ahead

Iâ€™m truly excited to embark on this journey and canâ€™t wait to see where it leads. The next few months will undoubtedly be filled with challenges, but also opportunities for growth. By sharing my process openly, I hope others can learn alongside me, and maybe even contribute their own insights.

Feel free to **watch**, **star**, or **fork** this repository to follow along. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration offers!

Iâ€™ll be posting updates soon. The project **starts today**!
